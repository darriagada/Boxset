## Download
You can always download the [latest release from here](https://github.com/darriagada/Boxset/releases).

## Requisites
Since these are PSDs files, you'll need [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) to open them. Works with Photoshop CS6 and later.

## How-To & Tweaks
You can visit the [Boxset wiki](https://github.com/darriagada/Boxset/wiki) to learn more about the usage and best practices. If you run into problems, you can always have a look at the [Known Issues chapter](https://github.com/darriagada/Boxset/wiki/Known-Issues). And if things go even further, you should open a new issue to let me know!

## About
I was in a hurry and couldn't find an specific box mockup for a project so I ended up making one from scratch. It's a little bit rough on the edges but it does the job. Of course I didn't want to let the files rot in my drive and maybe someone else will find it useful one day, so here it is!

## Déjà vu
Probably. I launched this on Gumroad in 2019 but I wanted to make it free, so everybody can use it.

## License

I hope you like it!
