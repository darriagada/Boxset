## About
I was in a hurry and couldn't find an specific box mockup for a project so I ended up making one from scratch. It's a little bit rough on the edges but it does the job. Of course I didn't want to let the files rot in my drive and maybe someone else will find it useful one day, so here it is!

Originally, I launched this on Gumroad in 2019 but now I wanted to make it free for everybody.
